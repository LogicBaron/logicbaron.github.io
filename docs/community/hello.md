# Hello

:::tip

Hello and thank you for visiting **ðŸ—¿magnalapis**.

:::

&nbsp **ðŸ—¿magnalapis** is my personal wiki where I, as an ML and AI engineer, compile and organize what I've learned.


## Active Team {#active-team}

&nbsp This webpage is being developed by a solo developer.

&nbsp However, I always welcome those who want to contribute and collaborate.

<ActiveTeamRow />


## Features

&nbsp The articles in **ðŸ—¿magnalapis** always aim for a **deeper and more fundamental understanding** than what's typically found online. While this might make the content more challenging, I assure you it offers richer insights.

&nbsp But I do strive to make my writing **accessible**. Generally, I introduce the main concepts and key details at the beginning, with more in-depth explanations following.

&nbsp Lastly, the articles on magnalapis will likely be **written in Korean** for now. I've been considering English, but given its pros and cons, I haven't made a decision yet.
